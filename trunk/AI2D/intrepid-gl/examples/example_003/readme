example_003 - Super Crono World!

This is a wacky tutorial we wrote to demonstrate some of the cool features in Intrepid...

In this tutorial you'll get some of this:

-Gravity
-Walls
-Keyboard control (jumping, walking..)
-Scrolling
-Mouse
-Buttons

There's lots more we should write about. Example 004 is coming soon...

Library used to compile: intrepid 0.1 alpha

Please, download the library in our site... we don't include the library in our samples because:
1. it would take extra space
2. doing like this, we don't have to publish examples for linux and windows separate
3. it's not difficult to download the appropriate binary file and follow the instructions on how to configure it
4. Plus. we want you to visit us often :)

We specify the library used because there can be some changes on already done functions from a version to another.
