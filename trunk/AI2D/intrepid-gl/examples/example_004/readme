example_004 - Menu prototype

Library used to compile: intrepid 0.2 alpha

Please, download the library in our site... we don't include the library in our samples because:
1. it would take extra space
2. doing like this, we don't have to publish examples for linux and windows separate
3. it's not difficult to download the appropriate binary file and follow the instructions on how to configure it
4. Plus. we want you to visit us often :)

We specify the library used because there can be some changes on already done functions from a version to another.
