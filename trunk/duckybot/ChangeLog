Version 1.1
===========
+ New batch mode: type "ProgramQ -h" for options. Mainly:
  * Possibility to run a regression and exit
  * Display of nodes' tree in debug.log file
  * Specify a given AIML subset
  * Reply to an input an exit
+ Integrated TestSuite regression from RebeccaAIML.
  Regression helped to identify some problems that are fixed now:
  * Condition matching is no more case insensitive
  * Support lowercase tag
  * Support <html:br> tag
  * Support of multi-array that
  * Fixed problems with nested random & condition
  * Support of topicstar tag
  * Fast detection and breaking of complex infinite loop
+ better matching algorithm (faster also?): Fix this error:
  For the sentence "ProgramQ is cool but not perfect",
  the pattern "* is *" is matched instead of "* but *" wherever
  the order in which come these patterns
+ Improved nodemapper building:
  * words are no more sorted alphabetically but
    inserted in parse order (new ones first)
+ Migrated under Qt 4 (still working with Qt3 though)
+ Improved system tag handling
  * Support windows
  * Faster execution
  * System stdout output containing \n is now better formatted
+ Replaced user input line edit with a combo box:
  * Keeps history of user input
  * Auto-completion enabled
+ No more support of HTML (HTML code is not interpreted anymore)
+ Code refactoring to speed up execution a bit
+ 'that' sentences are now splitted by semicolon ; as well
+ Improved space handling
+ Debug file contains log of all conversations (with indented srai)
+ Added more substitutions (inspired by Program D):
  * Substitutions now support regular expressions
  * Substitutions are case insensitive
  * Substitutions were not done in the entered order but in the alphabetic one
+ Source code provided as an eclipse project
+ Reversed aiml v0.3 integrated
+ Charlix v0.3 integrated

Version 1.0
===========

+ New tags support (more compliant with AIML 1.0.1)
  + Added support for the system tag (Works only on *nix systems for the moment) 
  + Implemented the input tag (with its index)
  + Support for the learn tag (still experimental but seems to work!)
  + Support for uppercase
+ bot.vars text file is migrated into bot.xml xml file
+ New vars.xml file:
  + loaded at startup
  + Saved back when the AIMLParser class is destroyed (backup file saved as well)
+ Log file:
  * Message error when an aiml file has not been correctly parsed
  * Highlight warnings when an unknown tag has been parsed
  * Contains system execution trace
+ Copied popup script file along with the QAIML binary
+ Added new English contractions ('s,'m, ...) substitutions in the substitutions.xml file
+ template-side 'that' tag was not supporting the index attribute
+ Limiting the that & input lists to 50 items (to avoid overflow)
+ srai & sr tags were modifying the input & that lists
+ "What is *" was not working correctly => Corrected by fixing spaces strategy when parsing xml: A space is automatically added between 2 sibling non-text xml elements
+ Graph master updated to allow "overwriting" of new categories
+ All the characters are now accepted as the user input
