0.6.0:
 - Upgraded to PyAIML version 0.8.4.  This version includes support for
   multiple wildcards in AIML patterns, the "index" attribute of the "star"
   AIML elements, and Unicode input and AIML files.
 - Improved error-handling during front-end module initialization.  Previously,
   any errors were mistakenly reported as "could not find valid frontend class"
   warnings.
 - AIM: Replaced broken PyTOC module with Twisted's OSCAR module.
 - ICQ: Added support for the ICQ protocol.
 - IRC: Added support for the IRC protocol (courtesy of Jamie Turner).
 - JABBER: Modified jabber back-end to use the xmpppy package, instead of the
   apparently-defunct jabber.py.
 - MSN: Applied patch to msnp module to fix problem with redirect messages while
   logging in.
 - MSN: Fixed bug in msnp's __process_add() function.
 - MSN: Fixed bug in MSN frontend's friend-adding code.
 - XMLRPC: Wrapped call to register_introspection_functions() to allow it to run
   without crashing older versions of Python.


0.5.0:
 - Arbitrary switch from date-based snapshots to "real" version numbers
 - Upgraded AIML interpreter to PyAIML version 0.8.2.  This release fixes some
   crashes involving infinite AIML recursion and passing Unicode strings as
   input to the bot.
 - Upgraded to MSNP 0.4.1.  The MSN front-end is now working!  I'll continue to
   improve it in future releases, but it should be quite usable for now.
 - Added Jabber chat front-end (based on jabber.py by Matthew Allum).
 - Added new "botinfo" section to the config file, used to customize your bot's
   personality.  Any entries added to this section are used to set up the
   bot predicates (accessed through the AIML <bot> element).

1/10/2004:
 - Upgraded AIML interpreter to PyAIML version 0.8.1.  Fixes a problem with "system"
   tags written for Windows not working on UNIX, and vice versa.  For cross-platform
   compatibility, all "system" tags should use UNIX-style pathnames (e.g.
   "path/to/script").
 - Added "unix-install.py" helper script to automate some necessary setup steps on UNIX
   platforms.
 - Removed some Python 2.3-specific features; Howie should now run on Python 2.2.x.
 - Howie now prompts for screenname/password at startup if the values aren't specified
   in the config file (useful for those who don't like leaving passwords lying around
   in plaintext on disk).
 - Reorganized and commented configuration file.

1/9/2004:
 - Upgraded AIML interpreter to PyAIML version 0.8.
 - Upgraded msnp package to v0.4.0 (the frontend still doesn't work, though).
 - Added XMLRPC front-end.
 - Added support for "what does X stand for" questions (acronym expansion).
 - Added support for persistent session data (so Howie remembers the people he's
   talked to even after he's rebooted).  To enable, set "sessionspersist" to "yes"
   in howie.ini

12/17/2003:
 - New pure-Python AIML interpreter (out with J-Alice, in with PyAIML,
   version 0.5).
 - Fixed minor bugs in Googlism code.
 - Added some missing tags in AIML files.
 - Bot name and verbosity are now initialized from the config file.
 - Added support for conversation logging (enabled in the config file).
 - Howie can now answer "what rhymes with X?" questions.
 - Installer now lets you customize which optional extension modules are
   installed.

12/1/2003: "Apocalypse Howie (Dev-20031201) is released
 - Fixed bug in front-end loader that required a bunch of otherwise
   unnecessary Python scripts to be included with a binary installation.
 - Fixed broken sync-mode <system> tags on Win32 builds!  This is huge --
   sync-mode <system> tags will be the keystone of Howie's future
   functionality.
 - Added a "scripts" directory, as a repository for the add-on commands
   that Howie will run from inside <system> tags.
 - Added a "my-howie.aiml" file for users to fill with their own custom AIML
   responses.
 - Moved Googlisms back-end into a stand-alone Python script, triggered through
   AIML using a sync-mode <system> tag.  This is the future!

11/21/2003: "Return of the Howie Extended Edition" (Dev-20031121) is released
 - Windows binary distribution is now a self-contained executable.
   On Windows systems, Python is no longer required to run Howie.
 - Added documentation folder, mostly pertaining to compiling the sources.

11/19/2003: "Return Of The Howie" (Dev-20031119) is released
 - Updated J-Alice to version 0.5.  See the J-Alice homepage for summary
   of new features.

5/30/2003: "Finding Howie" (Dev-20030530) is released
 - Fixed J-Alice bug which caused Howie to repeat his first response
   over and over.
 - Massive code reorganization makes adding new frontends a breeze!
 - Connection parameters are read from the new configuration file,
   howie.ini.
 - Added command-line interface (force command-line only with the -l flag).

5/15/2003: "Howie Reloaded" (Dev-20030515) is released
 - initial pre-pre-alpha version, Windows installer only.
 - AIM only
