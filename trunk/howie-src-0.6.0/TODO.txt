Additional frontends:
 - WEB: In progress.

Additional extension modules:
 - Email spoofer.
 - Address book / contact manager
 - Sysadmin assistant

Other features:
 - Auto-configuration tool (script, GUI)
 - Add the ability to initiate a chat session (either when a buddy logs in, or
   at the request of another buddy (e.g. "Hey, you should talk to SoAndSo").
   This will be easy in AIM, difficult in MSN (ask Mannu), and pretty much
   impossible in web/XMLRPC.
