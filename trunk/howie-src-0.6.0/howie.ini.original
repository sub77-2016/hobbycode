# -------------------------------------
# logging: should the bot keep logs of all conversatons [yes/no]
# logdir: if logging is enabled, which directory should the logs be kept in?
# maxdelay: maximum artificial delay (in seconds) between responses.  Used
#           to make the bot seem more human.
# sessionspersist: Should the bot use persistent sessions? (basically, should
#                  it remember what it learns about its visitors if the bot
#                  is restarted? [yes/no]
# sessionsdir: If persistent sessions are enabled, which directory should the
#              session data be saved to?
# verbose: Should the bot print extra debugging information [yes/no]
