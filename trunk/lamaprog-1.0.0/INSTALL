LamaProg v 0.2

* Dependencies: This software have no special requirement, it use only standard 
c libraris (stdio.h, unistd.h, terminos.h, fcntl.h, string.h, stdlib.h, gettext)
and interlocalication librarys (locale.h, libintl.h)


* Instalation:

1) decompress prog-0.2.1.tgz 
    'tar xzvf prog-0.2.1.tgz'

2) then go to source directory
    'cd lamaprog-0.2.1/prog-sw'
    
3) run make (configuration is made in Makefile)
    'make'
   
4) install
    'make install'
    
* Manual installation:
If automatic installation (make install) failed make three steps bellow

a) copy prog binary to executable directory (~/bin, /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin, ...)
    'cp prog ~/bin'

b) if you will use czech localization copy prog.mo to your locale              
   directiory (/usr/share/locale/cs_CZ/LC_MESSAGES)                            
    'cp prog.mo /usr/share/locale/cs_CZ/LC_MESSAGES'
    
c) User uses the programmer have to have write access to /dev/ttySX (to 
   serial port device). This is depend on your system, in my system (suse 7.2)
   I add user to group tty. The simplest way is to give write access to all.
    'chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0'
