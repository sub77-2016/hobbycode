LamaProg v 1.0.0


    COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

Communication protocol is UART (8b, 1stop, 9600Bd, without parity)
     
All commands - begins with colon (':')
             - ends with space (' ')
             - all leters are small caps
	     - numbers and data are transfered in hexadecimal ascii format,
	       high byte first, all letters are big (161 = "A1", 43981 = "ABCD")
	     - returs '+' or '-' by the end of command 
	       ('+' = positive, '-' = negative); '+' or '-' are the last letter
	       send via serial chanel


Commands depend on selected device. All devices must have implemented these
two commands

1) Programer version -- ":v " (returns banner ie. "LamaProg v 0.1+")
2) Go to init state (quit) -- ":q " (returns +)

Recomendet commands
-read N bytes from address A ":rNNAAAA " (returns data and + or -)
-write N data bytes form address A ":wNNAAAADDDD... " (returns + or -)
-chip erase ":e "
-read signature bytes ":s " (retuns signature and + or -)
-write lock bytes ":lNN " (returns + or -)




    DEVICE "a" -- Atmel 8051
erase -- ":e "
set address AAAA -- ":aAAAA " 
read NN bytes -- ":rNN "
write NN data bytes DD...DD -- ":wNNDD...DD "
read signature -- ":s "

 
    DEVICE "j" -- i2c eeproms
read NN bytes from address AAAA -- ":rNNAAAA "
write NN bytes DD...DD form address AAAA -- ":wNNAAAADD...DD "


    DEVICE "i" -- rs232 <-> i2c convertor
read data byte -- ":r " (return a+ or n+ (ack / no ack)
write data byte DD -- ":wDD "
write ack -- ":a+ "
wirte nak -- ":a- "
generate start condition -- ":s "
generate stop condition -- ":t "
