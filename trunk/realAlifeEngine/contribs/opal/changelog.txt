Version 0.3.1
October 19, 2005
============================================================

Release Notes
----------------------------------------------------
None.

Change Log
----------------------------------------------------
* 8-27-05: Corrected calculation of stress on joints. (Oleksandr Lozitskiy)
	
* 8-16-05: Added VC8 project files for sample apps. (Tyler Streeter)

* 8-16-05: Removed iterator from Solid::internal_applyForces to avoid assertions from VC++ 8.0 "Debug Iterator Support." (Tyler Streeter)

* 8-16-05: Added VC8 (i.e. .NET 2005) project file. (Tyler Streeter)

* 8-6-05: Fixed bug in ODE function found by EarthquakeProof - a VolumeSensor using a volume Solid with an offset shape caused a segmentation fault when getting user data from its ODE geomID in ODESimulator::internal_queryVolume.  (Tyler Streeter)

* 7-27-05: Fixed 'simple' sample app's SConstruct to make it install to the right place.  Also, in the same app, changed the SDL.h include to look in <SDL/SDL.h>, not <sdl/SDL.h>.  (Tyler Streeter)

* 7-21-05: Added 'getLocalAABB' function to ShapeData.  Added 'getLocalAABB' and 'getGlobalAABB' functions to Solid. (Tyler Streeter)

* 7-19-05: Performance improvement, especially for simulations with a lot of sleeping Solids.  (In Simulator::simulate(), we were previously copying an updated transform matrix for each dynamic Solid every time step.  Now we only perform this operation for dynamic, awake Solids.) (Tyler Streeter)

* 7-19-05: Cleaned up more Visual Studio warnings in Matrix44r::getQuaternion(). (Tyler Streeter)

* 6-26-05: Fixed ServoMotor's calculation of the angular velocity needed to bring the joint to the desired angle. Cleaned up some warning-generating code in Matrix44r::getQuaternion() (Oleksandr Lozitskiy)

* 6-24-05: Added 'simple' sample app. (Tyler Streeter)

* 6-24-05: Removed the OPAL_USE_MESH compile-time flag because it isn't needed.  (It was originally intended for IRIX usage because ODE's trimesh support doesn't compile on IRIX with certain versions of the MipsPro compiler.  However, the ODE trimesh function calls can still be used without trimeshes compiled into ODE; they just don't do anything.) (Tyler Streeter)

* 6-24-05: Fixed bug where collisions between two static Solids (at least one of them using a CollisionEventHandler) caused a crash in an ODE function call.  Thanks to EarthquakeProof in the forum for catching this.  (Tyler Streeter)

* 6-24-05: Put TinyXml source in with the OPAL source to make it easier to build for everyone. (Tyler Streeter)

* 6-24-05: Added a compile-time flag OPAL_USE_DOUBLE which determines whether OPAL's reals are floats or doubles.  Also added a run-time check when a physics engine-specific Simulator (e.g. ODESimulator) is created to make sure OPAL's reals are the same size as the physics engine's reals. (Tyler Streeter)

* 6-19-05: New Spaces are now automatically children of the Simulator root Space.  Previously, there was no way for new Spaces to be children of the Simulator root Space. (Tyler Streeter)

* 6-4-05: Fixed bug in ServoMotor::init() that kept it from being enabled without explicitly enabling it. (Tyler Streeter)

* 6-4-05: Fixed bugs in MeshShapeData. (Tyler Streeter)

* 6-4-05: Improved mass calculations for mesh Shapes; they are now based on the mesh's bounding box. (Tyler Streeter)

* Fixed bug in Joint class that crashed when applying a force/torque to a Joint connected to a single Solid. (Tyler Streeter)

* Fixed XML loading bug which crashed on missing string attributes. (Tyler Streeter)

* Fixed bugs in Joint::getAnchor and Joint::getAxis.  Previously they returned the initial anchor and axis.  Now they return the current anchor and axis. (Tyler Streeter)

* Fixed bug in Simulator::setupContactGroups; making two groups not generate contacts wasn't working properly. (Tyler Streeter)

Change Log
----------------------------------------------------
* All objects can now be created from and saved to a data object (Tyler Streeter)

* Collision events now get queued up during collision detection and handled at the end of each time step (Tyler Streeter)

* Added AccelerationSensor, InclineSensor, RaycastSensor, and VolumeSensor (Tyler Streeter)

* Overhauled XML loading system; now all Solid, Joint, Motor, and Sensor data can be loaded from OPAL XML files (Tyler Streeter)

* Increased stability when using ODE for freely-spinning objects with non-symmetric inertia tensors (Tyler Streeter)

* Added contact group system to give users more control over contact generation (Tyler Streeter)

* Joints have a parameter to allow or ignore contacts between connected Solids (Tyler Streeter)

* Added an option to allow or ignore contacts between static and sleeping Solids (Tyler Streeter)
