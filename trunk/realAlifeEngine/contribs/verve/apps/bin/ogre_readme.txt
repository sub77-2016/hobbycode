A few things need to be in place before running Ogre applications:

1. The 'ogre_plugins*' and 'ogre_resources.cfg' files should be in the same directory as the executables.
2. The paths in 'ogre_resources.cfg' must point to the correct resource directories.
3. The 'PluginsFolder' path in the 'ogre_plugins*' files must point to the directory where the Ogre plugins are installed.
