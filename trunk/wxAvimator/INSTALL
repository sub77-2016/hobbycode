To build Avimator, take the following steps:

1. Download the FLTK source:
http://ftp.easysw.com/pub/fltk/1.1.7/fltk-1.1.7-source.tar.gz
2. Untar it into a temporary directory and change to that directory
3. Execute: ./configure --enable-gl --enable-localpng --prefix=/usr
4. Execute: make
5. Execute: make install
6. Download the avimator source:
http://avimator.com/downloads/avimator-X.Y-src.tar.gz
7. Untar it into a temporary directory and change to that directory
8. Edit "Makefile" and uncomment the line that matches your platform.
   Use "MINGW=1" for Windows. Currently, you will need to install mingw 
   (http://www.mingw.org/) to compile it on Windows. If you make a project file
   for Microsoft Visual Studio, please send me a copy and I will include it 
   with the source. Thanks!
9. Execute: cd iksolver
10. Execute: make
11. Execute: cd ..
12. Execute: make

That's it!  You should now have a new binary called "avimator".  Run
that from the command line.  If you run into problems, please visit the 
Avimator forum (http://www.avimator.com/forums) and post a bug.

Thanks!
